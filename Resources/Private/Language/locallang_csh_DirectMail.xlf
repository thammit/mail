You may personalize the direct mails that will be sent to each recipient by inserting the following markers in content elements of the newsletter page. The markers will be substituted with the corresponding value found in each recipient record, whenever available:

###USER_uid### (the unique id of the recipient)
###USER_name### (full name)
###USER_firstname### (first name calculated)
###USER_NAME### and ###USER_FIRSTNAME### will insert uppercase versions of the equivalents
###USER_title###

1. Fetch and compile mail content: this option lets you fetch or acquire the content of the direct mail which will be compiled in a special format for later mailing; this action must be performed before any other action may be taken; you should review the properties of the direct mail as presented on the screen, and edit them, if required, before fetching content.

2. Send a testmail: this option lets you send a test mail to make sure that the email messages that will be sent to the recipient list look as expected when received in a client email application.

3. Mass-send mail: this option lets you schedule the actual sending of the direct mail to a specific recipient list.

4. See statistics of this mail: this option lets you review statistics on the direct mail and the responses, and take action on returned mails; this option is available only after mass-sending the mail has been initiated.]]></source>
