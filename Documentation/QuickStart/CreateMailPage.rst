Create MAIL page
================

MAIL brings an own page type (#24, can be changed inside extension settings),
which appear as a new icon (letter within an envelope) above the page tree,
beside the other page type icons.

.. include:: /Images/MailPage.rst.txt

To create a new mail, just drag and drop the MAIL page icon inside the new
mail sys-folder created in the :ref:`corresponding configuration step <add-mail-sysfolder>`.

Now you can add content to the MAIL page using the normal page module.

As you may notice, only a few content elements are available, and some of
them do not work yet.

Currently only headline, text, text with image, text with media, image and
html are working.

Additionally (untested) it should be possible to add a news plugin.

The included content elements are inspired by EXT:luxletter. Thanks to in2code
for making it public.
