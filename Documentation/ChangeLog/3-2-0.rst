New features
------------

- The included NormalizeRecipientData Event Listener now normalizes the name of recipients.
  If the name field is empty, it now searches for the fields first_name, middle_name and last_name and uses them (combined) as replacements in case they are not empty as well.

- Add an example of how to prevent duplicate sendings using the new ManipulateMailRecipientsEvent introduced with version 3.1.0

..  attention::
  This example does not take into account that a duplicate recipient may have other categories.

- Enhance the ManipulateFrontendUserRecipients to also normalize the phone field (from telephone) if the source is table
