Bug Fixes & Changes
-------------------


- Creating and sending mails in other languages then default (0) had some issues which needs to change several files:

  - Templates/Backend/Mail/Index.html (preview modals link changed)
  - ViewHelpers/PreviewLinksViewHelper.php (change way how to get links to translated pages and add page title to return array)
  - Configuration/TCA/tx_mail_domain_model_mail.php (remove 'languageField' => 'sys_language_uid', from the ctrl section, since this field is only used to fetch
    the right language from a given internal page, not from the mail record it self)

- Make all included viewhelpers future proof by changing them from renderStatic to render
