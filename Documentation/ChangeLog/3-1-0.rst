- Add ManipulateMailRecipientsEvent to manipulate the array of recipients of a mail after pressing the finish button in the mail wizard.

  This event can be helpful to remove duplicate email recipients comming from multiple selected recipient lists.

  Please note that recipients with the same email may have subscribed to different email categories. If this is the case and a mailing
  also uses the category function, caution is advised!
